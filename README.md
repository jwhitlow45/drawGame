# drawGame-Final
Final version of Pew Pew Game with a .exe file which can be run on any computer.

NOTE*: Upon first loading the game it will crash due to needing to create the initial save file. I have tried for a long time to figure out why this is the case and am just going to accept it for now as this was never meant to be a serious game in the first place.
There should be no issues after the initial crash upon first launching the game.

This is the first game I've ever made. It is a very basic concept where two players, or one player and the computer play to see who has better reactions time.
It is programmed in Lua using the LOVE2D engine. The reaction button for player 1 (the left player) is w and the one for player 2 (on the right) is the up arrow.
When playing against the computer the only controls active are for player 1.

A warning about the code. I made this before taking formal programming classes and it could be formatted much, much better. This game was actually made to try and teach myself better code organization.

Feel free to do whatever you like with the game/code. The source-code is located in a different repository named drawGame. The font and sounds were gotten from the internet and are not my own.
