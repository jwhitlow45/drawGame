# drawGame-Final
Final version of Pew Pew Game with a .exe file which can be run on any computer.

This is the first game I've ever made. It is a very basic concept where two players, or one player and the computer play to see who has better reactions time.
It is programmed in Lua using the LOVE2D engine. The reaction button for player 1 (the left player) is w and the one for player 2 (on the right) is the up arrow.
When playing against the computer the only controls active are for player 1.
